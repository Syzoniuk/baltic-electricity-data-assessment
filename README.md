# Baltic Energy Transparency Task – Task 1

This repository contains my solution to Task 1 of the Baltic Transparency technical assignment.

## Task 1 – Part 1: Imbalance Volumes Plot

The script `task1_energy_analysis.py` loads imbalance volume data from the official API and plots the electricity imbalance for Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and the aggregated Baltic region.

- [API used](https://baltic.transparency-dashboard.eu/documentation/api)
- Date range: 2025-02-07 to 2025-02-11
- Tools: Python, Requests, Pandas, Matplotlib

## Next steps
